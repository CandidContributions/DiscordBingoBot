## Getting started

### Running the source code

After cloning the repo you need to copy the "appsettings.json.secret.example" file as "appsettings.json.secret" and fill in all the settings.
Ways of obtaining these settings will be provided in the near future.

### Updating the words list

If you would like to make suggestions/alterations then you are welcome to submit a pull request to [the word list](DiscordBingoBot/wordList.csv). 

Bear in mind PRs won't be merged until we have approval from all four Contribs ðŸ˜‰
